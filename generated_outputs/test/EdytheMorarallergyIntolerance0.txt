 Your current medications include:

1. Listeria vaccine: This is a vaccine that is given to people who are at high risk of developing listeriosis, such as pregnant women, newborns, and individuals with weakened immune systems. It helps to build up the immune system and protect against listeriosis.
2. Antibiotics: Antibiotics are often used to treat listeriosis. The most common antibiotics used are ampicillin, amoxicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
3. Pain relievers: Some people with listeriosis may experience pain and fever, and may need to take pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen to manage these symptoms.
4. Other medications: Some people with listeriosis may also need to take other medications to manage other health conditions, such as antacids for heartburn or antidiarrheal medications for diarrhea.
