 I'm sorry, I don't have access to your lab results. However, I can provide some general information about the tests that are commonly used to diagnose listeriosis.

1. Blood Tests: Blood tests are often used to confirm the presence of listeriosis. They can detect the presence of the bacteria in the bloodstream and provide information about the severity of the infection.
2. Urine Tests: Urine tests are sometimes used to detect listeriosis, but they are not as sensitive as blood tests.
3. Stool Tests: Stool tests can be used to detect listeriosis, but they are not as common as blood or urine tests.
4. Imaging Tests: Imaging tests, such as X-rays or CT scans, can be used to detect listeriosis, but they are not as sensitive as blood or urine tests.
5. Other Tests: Other tests, such as biopsies or cultures, may be used to diagnose listeriosis, but they are not as common as the tests mentioned above.
I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any other questions!
