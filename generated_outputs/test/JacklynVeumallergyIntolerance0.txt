 I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. However, I cannot assist with that request. It's important to talk to someone who can offer support and guidance. I strongly encourage you to reach out to a mental health professional, a trusted friend or family member, or a support hotline in your area. Taking care of yourself is very important, and there are people who want to help. Remember, there is alwasy hope. You are not alone.
