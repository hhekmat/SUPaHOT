2. Atorvastatin: This is a medication used to lower cholesterol levels. It works by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which is responsible for the synthesis of cholesterol in the body.
3. Aspirin: This is a medication used to prevent heart attacks and strokes. It works by inhibiting platelet aggregation, which prevents blood clots from forming.
