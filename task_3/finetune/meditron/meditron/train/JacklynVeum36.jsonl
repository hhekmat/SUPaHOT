The normal pH of urine is between 4.5 and 8.0. A pH of 5.5 or lower is considered acidic, while a pH of 6.5 or higher is considered alkaline. The pH of urine test is used to diagnose and monitor conditions such as urinary tract infections, kidney stones, and kidney disease. A high pH of urine can indicate an underlying condition, such as a urinary tract infection or kidney stones. A low pH of urine can indicate dehydration or an underlying condition, such as diabetes or kidney disease."}
