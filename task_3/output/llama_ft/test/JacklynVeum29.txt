Based on the observation of a urine test for leukocyte esterase on September 27, 2023, during a specific encounter, the result was negative, indicating that there were no leukocytes present in your urine. Leukocyte esterase is an enzyme produced by white blood cells, and its presence in urine can be an indicator of a urinary tract infection (UTI). However, a negative result does not necessarily mean that you do not have a UTI, as the test may not always be accurate or sensitive enough to detect it. If you are experiencing symptoms such as burning during urination, frequent urination, or abdominal pain, you should consult with your healthcare provider for proper evaluation and treatment.
