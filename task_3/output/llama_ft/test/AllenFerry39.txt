Unfortunately, I cannot provide information on your last general examination or medication prescribed to you in 2008 as there are no relevant resources in your medical record. It is important to keep track of your medical history and examinations, including dates and medications prescribed, to ensure accurate and comprehensive records. You may want to consult with your healthcare provider or request a copy of your medical records to obtain this information.
