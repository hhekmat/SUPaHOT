Thank you for asking! Based on the information provided in your summaries, it appears that your last Epinephrine injection was ordered by Dr. Darrick836 on [date]. However, the status of the medication request is "stopped," which means that the injection has not been administered. I apologize, but I cannot provide you with the exact date of your last Epinephrine injection without access to your complete medical record.
