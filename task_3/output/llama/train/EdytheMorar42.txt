Of course, I'd be happy to help! Based on the information provided in the summaries, the patient's respiratory rate on July 7, 2020 was 16 breaths per minute. Unfortunately, the summary does not provide information on the patient's respiratory function on December 17, 2020.

However, if you would like to know how the patient's respiratory rate on July 7, 2020 compares to their respiratory function on December 17, 2020, I can tell you that the normal respiratory rate for an adult is between 12-20 breaths per minute. So, if the patient's respiratory rate on July 7, 2020 was 16 breaths per minute, it falls within the normal range.

Please let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!
