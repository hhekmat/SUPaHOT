Thank you for reaching out with your question. Based on the information provided in your medical record, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) assessment conducted on September 2, 2020, did show some concerns about your alcohol consumption.

According to the AUDIT assessment summary, your score was 12 out of 40, which falls in the "Hazardous Drinking" category. This suggests that your alcohol consumption may be putting your health at risk.

The assessment also noted that you reported drinking alcohol on 10 of the last 14 days, which is above the recommended limit of 7-10 days per week. Additionally, you reported drinking more than 7 drinks on 3 occasions in the past year, which is also a cause for concern.

Based on these findings, it is important for you to be aware of your alcohol consumption and its potential impact on your health. Your healthcare provider may recommend further evaluation or treatment to address any alcohol-related issues.

If you have any questions or concerns about your alcohol consumption or the AUDIT assessment, please feel free to ask.
