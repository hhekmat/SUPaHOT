Based on the information provided in the summaries, it appears that Verapamil Hydrochloride 40 MG was indeed prescribed for the same condition as your current medication.

According to the first summary, Dr. Alexa Casper ordered Verapamil Hydrochloride 40 MG on January 17, 2017, but the status is marked as stopped. This means that the medication was prescribed at some point in the past, but it is no longer being used or has been discontinued.

The second summary indicates that Dr. Alexa Casper ordered Verapamil Hydrochloride 40 MG again on February 9, 2021. This suggests that the medication has been prescribed for the same condition at least twice, which is likely indicative of its effectiveness in managing that condition.

However, I recommend consulting with your healthcare provider for more detailed information and guidance on your specific medication regimen.
