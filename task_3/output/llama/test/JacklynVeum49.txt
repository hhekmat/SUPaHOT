Hello! I'm happy to help you with your inquiry. Based on the summary provided in your medical record, your glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as of your last lab test in September 2023 was 57.116 mL/min/1.73m2.

According to the National Kidney Foundation, the normal range for GFR varies by the patient's age and gender. For a 55-year-old male, the normal range for GFR is typically between 60 and 120 mL/min/1.73m2. Your GFR of 57.116 mL/min/1.73m2 falls within this normal range for your age and gender, which is good news!

It's important to note that GFR is a measure of how well your kidneys are functioning, and it can be affected by various factors such as age, sex, and underlying medical conditions. If you have any concerns or questions about your GFR or your overall kidney health, I recommend speaking with your healthcare provider. They can provide you with more detailed information and recommendations based on your individual situation.
