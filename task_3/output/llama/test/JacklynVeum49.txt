Thank you for reaching out with your question! Based on the information provided in your medical record, your glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as of your last lab test on September 27, 2023, was 57.116 mL/min/1.73m2. According to the National Kidney Foundation, the normal range for GFR varies by age: * For adults aged 18-60: 90-120 mL/min/1.73m2 * For adults aged 61-70: 80-110 mL/min/1.73m2 * For adults aged 71 and older: 60-90 mL/min/1.73m2 Based on your age (63 years old), your GFR of 57.116 mL/min/1.73m2 falls within the normal range for your age group. This means that your kidneys are functioning within the normal range for someone of your age. It's important to note that GFR is just one measure of kidney function, and it may not always accurately reflect the level of kidney damage or disease present. Your healthcare provider may also consider other factors, such as your medical history, physical examination, and other laboratory test results, when evaluating your kidney function. If you have any concerns or questions about your kidney function or overall health, please don't hesitate to ask your healthcare provider. They can provide you with personalized advice and recommendations based on your individual situation.
