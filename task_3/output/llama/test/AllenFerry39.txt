I apologize, but based on the information provided, there are no relevant medical resources available in your patient's record from 2008. As a result, I cannot provide you with the information you are seeking.

However, I would recommend that you schedule a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician to discuss any concerns you may have regarding your medical history. They will be able to provide you with the most up-to-date information about your medical records and any medications that may have been prescribed to you in the past.

Additionally, you may want to consider requesting a copy of your medical records from your healthcare provider, which can provide you with a detailed account of your medical history, including any previous exams and medications that have been prescribed to you.

Please let me know if there is anything else I can help with.
