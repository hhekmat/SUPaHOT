Based on the information in your medical record, it appears that Naproxen sodium was requested by Dr. Darrick836 Franecki195 with the status of "stopped" and an instruction to take as needed. There is no mention of Jolivette in the provided summary, so it is not possible to determine if you started taking Naproxen sodium before or after Jolivette based on this information. If you need more specific details about the timing of when you started taking these medications, I recommend reaching out to your healthcare provider for further clarification.
