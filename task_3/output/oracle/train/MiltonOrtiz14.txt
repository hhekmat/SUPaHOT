MCV stands for Mean Corpuscular Volume, which is a measurement of the average volume of a red blood cell. A normal MCV range is typically between 80 to 100 femtoliters (fL). Your latest MCV count of 90.196 fL on December 2, 2020 falls within the normal range, indicating that the size of your red blood cells is normal. This value suggests that there may not be any significant issues with the size of your red blood cells that could impact your health.
