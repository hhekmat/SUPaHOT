Based on the information in your medical record summary, the result of your depression screening on 09-27-2023 was that the screening procedure was completed at MASS GENERAL BRIGHAM URGENT CARE LLC on that date. Unfortunately, the summary does not provide the specific result of the screening. If you would like more detailed information about the result, I recommend contacting the healthcare provider who conducted the screening.
