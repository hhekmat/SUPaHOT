I'm sorry, but based on the summary provided, there is no specific information about your last visit for the same problem you've been experiencing or any changes in your triglyceride levels. It seems to be related to a different medical issue involving a malignant neoplasm of the breast. If you need more information about your specific health concerns, I recommend reaching out to your healthcare provider for detailed records.
