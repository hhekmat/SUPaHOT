Nitrites are a byproduct of the breakdown of nitrogenous compounds in the body. The presence of nitrites in the urine indicates that there is an excess of nitrogenous compounds in the body. This could be due to a variety of factors, including an excess of protein in the diet, a high-protein diet, or a kidney problem.
