I'm sorry, but without specific information about the lab tests you are referring to, I am unable to provide you with the results. If you have access to your lab test results, I recommend reviewing them with your healthcare provider for a detailed explanation and interpretation. If you have any specific questions about the results or need help understanding them, feel free to ask!
