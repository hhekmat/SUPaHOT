I'm sorry, but without actual blood pressure readings, I cannot provide you with your current blood pressure reading. If you have a blood pressure monitor at home, you can take your blood pressure and monitor it regularly to keep track of your readings. If you have any concerns about your blood pressure, it's best to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate assessment.
