Yes, you should be concerned about your history of gout and essential hypertension. Both conditions require ongoing management and monitoring to prevent complications. Gout is a type of arthritis caused by high levels of uric acid in the blood, leading to painful joint inflammation. Essential hypertension is high blood pressure with no identifiable cause, which can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other health issues. It is important to work closely with your healthcare provider to control these conditions through lifestyle changes and medication to reduce the risk of complications.
