I'm sorry, but without specific details from your last blood work, I am unable to provide you with the exact results. However, based on the pseudo patient data you provided, it seems that all parameters were within normal levels. If you have any concerns or questions about your blood work results, it would be best to consult with your healthcare provider for a detailed explanation.
