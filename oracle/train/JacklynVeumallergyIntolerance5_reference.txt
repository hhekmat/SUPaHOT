Based on the information provided, it seems that there are no allergies listed in your medical records. Allergy information is typically documented in the "allergyIntolerance" section of medical records, but in this case, no relevant FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) resources were found for allergies. It's always a good idea to consult with your healthcare provider for accurate and up-to-date information regarding your allergies.
